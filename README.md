# CLRS-STL-codes
C++(STL) codes of most of the important data structures and algorithms given in CLRS. I tried to keep the variables and helper functions as close to source material as possible.

There are 3 sections in repository.

CLRS Part-1 contains chapter 1-9(Introduction, Searching and Sorting).

CLRS Part-2 contains chapter 10-17(Data Structures and Algorithm Designs Techniques).

CLRS Part-3 contains chapter 21-25(Advanced Data Structures and Graphs).

This repository does not contain codes for many advanced data structures and algoritms(such as RB Trees) because there are already very good libraries for them so knowing about them is more useful than implementing them.

This repository also does not provides any theoritical portion of CLRS(buy the book for this).
